# Answering Funnel Questions with Power BI
This is a data analysis I made for Tu Cantón a real state mexican company, the client asked me to answer 6 questions so the entire analysis goes around then more than an exploratory analysis or a data analysis for modeling. 

You can watch the results below or go the the [table of contents.](#Table-Of-Contents)



# Results Answering The Questions
I will add photos of the whole report this time, If you want to watch the report online go to this [link.](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZWQyMjQxMDEtZjIyMC00OWFkLTkwYmYtMmVlZDVlYjZiZjNiIiwidCI6IjJlZGE0M2M5LTUxYzktNDAwMi1iZjJmLTlmY2QwMzZmNjdkNyJ9&pageName=ReportSectionf6913e9c09601dd278ae)

## What is the profile for the people who finish the pre-qualifier?

![Q1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58957744/116601265-ebb3a080-a8ef-11eb-8505-5ea5568eb9d5.png)

## How many funnels were in september for Estado de México and Baja California? and In what state did we lose the most funnels?

![Q2Q3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58957744/116601267-ec4c3700-a8ef-11eb-9382-fb3d69d2919b.png)


## What proportion of users from the infonavit credit funnel, don't have enough credit points? and How many unique users do more than one exercise in the pre-qualifier?

## Can you show us any finding you had?

# Data Wrangling And Engineering
This data needed a bit more than the usual sources, I had to do some feature engineering for the funnel and understand the vision of the people that explained me how the funnel works.

Anyway you can watch the whole file by [click](https://github.com/JorgePablol/Data-Analysis-Real-State-with-Power-BI/blob/main/LimpiaTuCanton.ipynb) I will add below some photos of the wrangling and engineering, not the purpose to explain it all.


## Data Cleaning
The data wasn't that dirty actually, the toughest part was on data engineering, almost any column had na's and had to drop some columns.

I will show just some parts of the code.

## Feature Engineering
Just a quick glance to the feature engineering.

# Data Analysis
Showing the code part to answer the questions before the visualization.

I will show just some parts of the code.
