# [Data Analysis Real-State with Power BI](#Table-Of-Contents)
This is a data analysis I made for Tu Cantón a real state mexican company, the client asked me to answer 6 questions so the entire analysis goes around then more than an exploratory analysis or a data analysis for modeling. 
You can watch the results below or go the the [table of contents](#Table-Of-Contents)

# [Data Wrangling And Engineering](#Table-Of-Contents)
This data needed a bit more than the usual sources, I had to do some feature engineering for the funnel and understand the vision of the people that explained me how the funnel works. Anyway you can watch the whole file by [click](https://github.com/JorgePablol/Data-Analysis-Real-State-with-Power-BI/blob/main/LimpiaTuCanton.ipynb) I will add below some photos of the wrangling and engineering, not the purpose to explain it all.


## Data Cleaning
The data wasn't that dirty actually, the toughest part was on data engineering, almost any column had na's and had to drop some columns.

## Feature Engineering
Just a quick glance to the feature engineering.
